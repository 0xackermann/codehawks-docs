# Payouts

For competitive audits, right now the payouts are calculated as such.

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- ```
Med Risk Shares: 3 * (0.9 ^ (findingCount - 1)) / findingCount
High Risk Shares: 10 * (0.9 ^ (findingCount - 1)) / findingCount

# Who judges?

As of V0.1, the [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io/) team exclusively judges the audits. We are working on a decentralized judging model to prevent bias. The Cyfrin team is not allowed to participate in audit competitions due to this.
