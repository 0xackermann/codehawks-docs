### What is a finding? 

A finding represents a vulnerability in the codebase, they are separeted *loosely* into 3 categories:

- High: Funds are directly or nearly directly at risk
- Medium: Funds are indirectly at risk
- Low & Gas: Funds are not at risk, but the code has issues 

However, if the protocol specifically states some different criteria, then that is what should be followed.
