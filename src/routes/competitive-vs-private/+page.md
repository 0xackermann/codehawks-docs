# Competitive vs Private Audits

*Be sure to read on [Audits](/audits/) before coming here.*

Competitive and private audits have different value props. 

## Differences

| Feature                  | Competitive audit       | Private Audit |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Cost                     | Slightly more expensive | Cheaper       |
| Number of auditors       | Hundreds                | 1 - 5         |
| Do they find everything? | Yes*                    | Yes*          |
| Personal feedback        | Less                    | More          |
| Who are the auditors?    | You don't know          | You know      |

## Similarities

- Duration of audit depends on code length

## Which one is better? 

Competitive audits have potentially hundreds of auditors looking at your codebase to find bugs. But not all auditors are the same. As of right now, it's hard to say which one is **better** and more that they are just **different**. 

We will be monitoring the differences between the two as the project grows.

Ideally, you do both!
